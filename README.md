# spy-tangency-portfolio
Randomized portfolio builder I made over the summer of 2020.

The key takeaway from this project is that building a tangency portfolio out of historical stock data can (on average) create a profitable portfolio, even if you don't know anything in-depth about the sector/company you're investing in.

## Inspiration for this strategy
In the beginning of the summer I took a class at UChicago called 'Quantitative Portfolio Management and Algorithmic Trading'. In the beginning of the class we learned about the importance of diversification â€” not just as a general concept, but as tool we could take advantage of. If you have two stocks, one which is considered a good investment (say has a high sharpe ratio) and the other which is considered a bad investment, you can create a portfolio which performs better on a backtest than either of those portfolios can by themselves. By creating a tangency portfolio that weighs each stock based on their performance, you can allocate certain percentages of your total investment (such as 80/20, or -20/120 if you want to short a stock) that takes advantage of the fact that stocks move together/against each other in a predictable manner. Furthermore, if you want to get a certain mean return out of this portfolio with the least amount of volatility possible, you can do so by conducting a mean-variance analysis which will change the weights of each stock to match the target mean return while reducing the variance of the portfolio as much as possible.

I also learned in the beginning of this class about the investment strategy used by Harvard in the case study "The Harvard Management Company and Inflation-Protect Bonds", written by Luis M. Viceira. In this paper I learned that in 2000, Harvard analyzed how they invested their endowment by using a mean-variance analysis. This is when I first realized the full power of diversification: if the Harvard Management Company could use the same analysis that I had learned, it must be a viable solution to creating a solid portfolio. 

However, Harvard did not just put a handful of stocks into a backet, run a mean-variance analysis on those stocks, and call it a day. Instead, they grouped stocks together into commonly used sections such as Domestic Equity, Foreign Equity, and more. Thus grew multiple layers of mean-variance analysis: (at least) one layer for grouping investments together into asset classes, and a higher layer for weighing asset classes into the final portfolio. This is advantageous for a couple of different reasons:

1) Conducting a mean-variance analysis on assets that are similar to one another can help narrow in how these assets correlate with one another. For instance, two stocks that are in the same sector are typically very correlated; that's almost by definition, as if they weren't similar they wouldn't be put into the same sector. By analyzing assets that are highly correlated with one another, you can differentiate between macro-level market swings that uniformly affect assets in this sector apart from events that actually show how these assets differentiate from one another. 

2) Conducting a mean-variance analysis on a large number of assets is not a stable way of conducting mean-variance analysis. One disadvantage of the mean-variance analysis is that, without any adjustments, the analysis assumes that all of the data it is given (data like historical information about asset prices) is extremely important and bound to occur in the future. If there are n assets in a portfolio, there are around n^2 covariances that the analysis asumes are factual, and it conforms the weights of each asset under the assumption that these covariances will not change. When they do change out-of-sample, this massively impacts the performance of the portfolio as there are a large number of coefficients changing at once. Ultimately, a larger dimensionality creates larger imprecision, so reducing this by creating multiple levels of mean-variance analysis helps minimize these problems.
