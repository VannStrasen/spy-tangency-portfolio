# spy-tangency-portfolio
Randomized portfolio builder I made over the summer of 2020.

The key takeaway from this project is that building a tangency portfolio out of historical stock data can (on average) create a profitable portfolio, even if you don't know anything in-depth about the sector/company you're investing in.

## Inspiration for this strategy
In the beginning of the summer I took a class at UChicago called 'Quantitative Portfolio Management and Algorithmic Trading'. In the beginning of the class we learned about the importance of diversification â€” not just as a general concept, but as tool we could take advantage of. If you have two stocks, one which is considered a good investment (say has a high sharpe ratio) and the other which is considered a bad investment, you can create a portfolio which performs better on a backtest than either of those portfolios can by themselves. By creating a tangency portfolio that weighs each stock based on their performance, you can allocate certain percentages of your total investment (such as 80/20, or -20/120 if you want to short the stock) that takes advantage of the fact that stocks move together/against each other in a predictable manner.
